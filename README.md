# NeopixelTcp

Neopixel TCP is a suite of software for making addressable RGB-Stripes show any data you want. At it's base Neopixel TCP is just a Software that allows clients
to take control over a Neopixel Stripe via TCP. This means you can easily control your Neopixel-Stripe from anywhere in your Wifi or LAN.

## Libraries

There are a few client libraries for different programming languages that allow you to control the neopixel server easily. The main library is written in C# however
there also is one for Java.

## Implementations

Neopixel TCP is made to be implemented into as much software as possible. For example there already are implementations for:

Games:
- Potion Craft
- Minecraft Java Edition (Currently only shows health)

Programs:
- Blender

More implementations are coming soon.

## Why?

I decided to develop this project because I was annoyed by the fact that there was no way to have a Neopixel-Stripe that could be used by multiple integrations.
Later I found out that there seem to be other (more professional) option that do this but honestly, I'd rather develop my own simple solution instead of learning an already created one in this case.
